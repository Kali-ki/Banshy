# Banshy

Banshy is a web extension that downloads and analyzes files in cloud, before downloading them to your computer.

When you click on a download, the extension blocks the download,then the backend downloads and analyzes the file, and returns the result to the front to releases the download or not.

‚ö†Ô∏è **This project is still in development. Some updates should come in the futur.**
**See last section of this page.**

# üöÄ Performances

Banshy does not yet analyze all type of files. Let's see the performances of each type of files :

| Type File | Well predicted    | Analyze type          |
| :-------- | :---------------: | :--------------------:|
| PDF       |   97%             | AI (random forests)   |
| EXE       |   49%             | Static analyzed       |
| MIC       |   43%             | Static analyzed       |

# üöß Improvements

**This is an open source project, feel free to contribute or suggest any ideas.**

Here is the list of all improvements that are planed :

- Create analyzers for : 

    - 1 - Office documents (.docx, .xlsx, .pptx, ...)
    - 2 - Compresed files (.zip, .rar, .7z)
    - 3 - HTML and JS (.html, .js)
    - 4 - DLL (.dll)
    - 5 - Installation files (.msi, .msix, ...)
    - 6 - Image files (.img, .iso)

- Find more PDF files. The current model for PDF prediction has been trained on a dataset of 800 PDFs.
But, it is too limited to say that the model can be applied to any PDF.

- Add Banshy extension to web store

- Host backend in a server
